TODO run thru spell check

This blog post is my attempt to organize all of the things I've learned while building my first pair of skis.
Building skis is tough, mostly because of the amount of available information online to sift through.

Note: If you are looking to build a snowboard, you may find value in this post as well.
Snowboards are strikingly similar to skis in their design and construction.

# Ski Construction Overview

## Ski Design

What type of ski would you like to ride?
Fast-turning skis to rip through groomers?
Floaty off-piste surfers?
Park skis that ride like [al dente pasta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXzuiz7Fzjo)?

Every ski modifies the same set of parameters to create a unique feel. These parameters include:
(Ranked roughly in order of importance)

1. Turn Radius
  - This is the result of the skis' length and width.
  - [Turn radius calculator](https://member.fis-ski.com/skicalc.htm)
  TODO
  - Ski Length
    - The length of the skis from tip to tail.
    - This parameter can vary on the rider's height and skill level.
      - A good rule of thumb is to ride skis that line up close to your eye-level when holding the skis vertically.
    - Effective edge is actually more important here TODO

    Some things to note:
    - Longer skis tend to *ride* faster than shorter skis.
      - This is because the force exerted by the skier is distributed over a larger and longer surface area, decreasing drag on the snow.
    - Shorter skis tend to *turn* faster than longer skis.
      - This is due to the . . .
  - Ski Width
    - Specifically, this is the width of the ski measured at the thinnest point, also called the "waist".

  - The sidecut is the "hourglass" shape a ski makes when viewing the ski from the top.
  It is the aggregate of the ski's length and the ski's width.
  - The turn radius is created by extending the sidecut of the ski into a full circle.
  - If you were riding skis with an 18 meter turn radius and you were to turn to the right, you would be riding clockwise along the perimeter of an 18 meter circle.
  TODO add diagram

  Example skis and their turn radius specs:
  - Ski racing skis generally have an agressive sidecut, yielding short, snappy turns.
  - Powder skis have a longer sidecut, because 
3. Ski Profile
  - The ski's profile is not flat. When viewed from the side, skis TODO
  - Traditionally, skis have a convex profile called "camber".
    - A cambered profile allows for a skier to apply an even amount of pressure along the edge of the ski in a turn.
    Also, skis with camber 
  - A concave profile is called "reverse camber" or "rocker", like the feet of a rocking chair.
  - This is influenced on the design of the ski press. TODO add link to ski press section?
4. Mounting location
  - The mounting location is the area where the skier's boots attach to the skis.
  This can range from the true center of the ski, to being ~10cm back from the center of the ski.
  - Center mounted or "Twin tip" skis allow the skier to more easily ski "switch" or backwards.
  The center of mass and pivot point is at the middle of the ski.
  -
5. Ski Thickness/Taper
  - Also known as a ski's "flex" or "flex pattern"
  - When viewing the skis from the side, you will see that the ski is thickest in the middle and thins out as you move to each tip.
  - TODO "Flex pattern"
6. Material Choice
  - Heavy wood charging ski
  - Light wood floaty/touring specific
  - Damp vs. poppy
  - Buttery

9. Tip shape

Note: Many of the paramaters you modify in the ski design will change other parameters.
For example, ski width and ski length are coupled with the turn radius.
If you design a long ski, the turn radius will inherently be larger.
If you design a wide ski, the turn radius will also be larger.

If you own a pair of skis you enjoy riding, it can be helpful to study how these parameters affect the ride.
Note how you would modify that pair of skis' parameters in a new ski design.

There's really no right or wrong choice for each of these parameters.

I'll cover more in-depth ski design tips in the [Designing in CAD Software] TODO section.

## Press Design

The ski press is a specialized tool that bonds together all the components of a ski to the right specification.
The design parameter that the ski press modifies is the skis' profile.

### Ski Molds
Ski Molds are designed to give the skis their profile.
They're made of MDF, which is cheap, cuts/sands to shape easily, and can withstand press pressure.

Some press designs use only the bottom mold.
Others use a bottom mold and an inverse top mold.
Typically, the molds are wide enough to hold 2 skis (or 1 snowboard) during the press.
TODO write about if the ski press is only 1 ski wide, it runs the risk of having inconsistent ski profiles.

### Types of Press Designs

Listed in increasing order of complexity.
TODO find that ski builders or happy monkey snowboard blog post with explainer on press designs

#### Clamp Press
The simplest press design.
The clamp press fits skis in between a top and bottom mold.
Pressure is then applied to the skis from the top using clamps or weight.
The weight can be from sandbags, buckets of water, or even a vehicle driven on top of the press.

This press design is the easiest and cheapest to build, but it outputs a relatively low amount of pressure, which can cause the final ski to not laminate properly.

#### Vacuum Press
This press works by placing the ski on top of the bottom section of a mold and covered in an air-tight film.
A vacuum is attached to the film and removes the air from the mold.
The pressure is generated by the negative

#### Pneumatic Press
This press is used by professional ski manufacturers.
The ski mold is typically only the bottom half, while the top section is displaced using an air bladder.
Some pneumatic presses use fire hoses as the bladder.


# Materials

Skis are made by sandwiching materials together using epoxy.
Each material gives a certain characteristic or function in the ski.

Starting from the bottom-up, here are the materials you'll find in most skis:
- Base material
  - This is the part that glides on the snow.
  It is made of P-Tex, a polyethylene plastic.
  This plastic comes in 2 varieties, each with their own properties:
    - Extruded
      - Formed by melting and molding the plastic into shape.
    - Sintered
      - Formed by grinding the plastic into a powder and pressing into shape.
      Sintering is similar to pressing a clump of snow together in your hands to create a snowball.
      The pressure causes the material to melt and re-form into a stronger state.
      - Sintered bases are more expensive, but are more pourous, allowing the ski to accept wax well.
      This leads to the ski being faster.
  - Base material is porous to accept wax - helping the ski glide faster.
- Edges
  - Steel with tabs
- Fiberglass fabric
  - Usually in a triaxial weave, meaning 3 strands of fiberglass are weaved together to create a cloth
- Wood Core
  - The most popular types of wood in skis are As
  - Occasionally you will find skis cores mixing species of wood to combine benefits.
  For example, a ski could be constructed of mostly Poplar with alternating Maple "stringers" in the middle.

# How I Built My Skis

## Design

Here are the specifications of my ski:
Length 182cm
Width 90mm
Turn Radius 20m
Rocker - Camber - Rocker profile
ABS TODO? Sidewalls
Bamboo Laminate Core
Symmetric sidecut
Sintered Base

I wanted to build a symmetric park ski with a damp feel.
The skis I took inspiration from were [ON3P's Magnus ski] and the [Vishnu Wet].

### Materials Tips
- Borrow, don't buy
- The MDF doesn't need to be top tier quality.
Check the discount 4'x8' section if it exists at your hardware store.
I was lucky enough to find MDF "blemished" with forklift marks at a heavy discount.

# My Build

## Template Ski
Print blueprint
Glue spray on mdf
Sand to the edges

## Bases

# Mounting

# Stone Grinding

# Graphics

# Mistakes / What I Would Do Differently Next Time

- Design of my skis didn't account for the 2mm width of the ski edges.
Everything but the topsheet needed to be cut -2mm along the entire perimeter.

# Resources

[Ski Builders Forum](http://www.skibuilders.com/phpBB2/) is the main resource for all things ski construction.
Most of my research and questions directed me there.
The posts on Ski Builders are great, but I found many of the images embedded in the posts were hosted on a now defunct image hosting site.
I've had some luck finding the old images by searching the history of specific posts on [Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/).

[J Skis Factory Tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4J_t5ym9II&ab_channel=Jskis)
One of the most clear and concise tours that walks through the entire ski build process.
