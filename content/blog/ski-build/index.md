Building skis is tough, mostly because of the amount of available information online to sift through.
This blog post is my attempt to organize all of the lessons I've learned while building my first pair of skis.

Note: If you are looking to build a snowboard, you may find value in this post as well.
Snowboards are strikingly similar to skis in their design and construction.

## Ski Design
What type of ski would you like to ride?
Fast-turning skis to rip through groomers?
Floaty off-piste surfers?
Park skis that ride like [al dente pasta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXzuiz7Fzjo)?

Every ski modifies the same set of parameters to create a unique feel. These parameters include:
(Ranked roughly in order of importance)

1. Turn Radius
  - This is the result of the skis' length and width.
  TODO
1. Ski Length
  - This is mostly dependent on the rider's height and skill level.
  The rule of thumb is to have skis that line up close to your eye-level when holding the skis vertically.

  Some things to note:
  - Longer skis tend to *ride* faster than shorter skis.
  This is because the force exerted by the skier is distributed over a larger and longer surface area, decreasing drag on the snow.
  - Shorter skis tend to *turn* faster than longer skis.
  This is due to the . . .
2. Ski Width
2. Turn Radius
  The turn radius is created by extending the sidecut of the ski into a full circle.
  The sidecut is the "hourglass" shape a ski makes when viewing the ski from the top.
  If you were riding skis with an 18 meter turn radius and you were to turn to the right, you would be riding clockwise along the perimeter of an 18 meter circle.

  Example skis and their turn radius specs:
  - Ski racing skis generally have an agressive sidecut, yielding short, snappy turns.
  - Powder skis have a longer sidecut, because 
4. Ski Profile
  - The ski profile
  - Traditionally, most skis 
  - This is influenced on the design of the ski press.
5. Mounting location
  - The mounting location is the area where the skier's boots attach to the skis.
  This can range from the true center of the ski, to being ~10cm back from the center of the ski.
  - Center mounted or "Twin tip" skis allow the skier to more easily ski "switch" or backwards.
  The center of mass and pivot point is at the middle of the ski.
  -
5. Ski Thickness/Taper
  - When viewing the skis from the side, you will see that the ski is thickest in the middle and thins out as you move to each tip.
  - TODO "Flex pattern"
6. Material Choice
  - Heavy wood charging ski
  - Light wood floaty/touring specific
  - Damp vs. poppy
  - Buttery

9. Tip shape

Note: Many of the paramaters you modify in the ski design will change other parameters.
For example, ski width and ski length are coupled with the turn radius.
If you design a long ski, the turn radius will inherently be larger.
If you design a wide ski, the turn radius will also be larger.

If you own a pair of skis you enjoy riding, it can be helpful to study how these parameters affect the ride.
Note how you would modify that pair of skis' parameters in a new ski design.

There's really no right or wrong choice for each of these parameters.

I'll cover more in-depth ski design tips in the [Designing in CAD Software] TODO section.

# Materials

Skis are made with many materials sandwiched together using epoxy.
Each material gives a certain characteristic or function in the ski.

Starting from the bottom-up, here are the materials you'll find in most skis:
- Base material
  - This is the part that glides on the snow.
  It is made of P-Tex, a polyethylene plastic.
  This plastic comes in 2 varieties, each with their own properties:
    - Extruded
      - Formed by melting and molding the plastic into shape.
    - Sintered
      - Formed by grinding the plastic into a powder and pressing into shape.
      Sintering is similar to pressing a clump of snow together in your hands to create a snowball.
      The pressure causes the material to melt and re-form into a stronger state.
      - Sintered bases are more expensive, but are more pourous, allowing the ski to accept wax well.
      This leads to the ski being faster.
  - Base material is porous to accept wax - helping the ski glide faster.



# Resources

[Ski Builders Forumn](http://www.skibuilders.com/phpBB2/) is the main resource for all things ski construction.
Most of my research and questions directed me there.
The posts on Ski Builders are great, but I found many of the images embedded in the posts were hosted on a now defunct image hosting site.
I've had some luck finding the old images by searching the history of specific posts on [Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/).
