When travelling to ski resorts, you'll notice a lot of patrollers wearing Kinco gloves. Why is this?
Turns out, Kinco gloves are a cheap and sturdy alternative to [similarly styled, $100 gloves](https://www.evo.com/gloves/burton-gondy-gore-tex-leather#image=152928/641950/burton-gondy-gore-tex-leather-gloves-.jpg).

# Materials*

- Kinco Gloves (choose a style)
  - ["Finger" style gloves](https://amzn.to/374ZRTE)
  - ["Chopper" style gloves](https://amzn.to/2CM1R5v)
- Waterproofing Beeswax
  - [Sno-Seal](https://amzn.to/357AZsD)
- Oven
- Baking Sheet
- Tin Foil

# Waterproofing Steps

### Pre-heat your oven to 150°F

- If your oven has a minimum temperature setting that's higher than this, pre-heat the oven to the minimum setting and crack the door open a bit.
- Sno-Seal recommends a temperature of 120°F. I found that heating the oven a bit more helped with absorption. Keep an eye on the gloves and be sure not to burn them!

### Prepare your baking sheet

- Line your baking sheet with tin foil and place your gloves palm side up.

### Bake gloves for 5 minutes

- Warming up the leather helps the Sno-Seal soak in and provide a nice water-tight seal.

### Apply Sno-Seal

- Put on the gloves (they should be nicely heated, not too hot), and flex open your fingers
  to open the pores in the leather.
- Take a healthy amount of Sno-Seal from the jar. Using a hand-washing motion, apply
  the wax to all areas of the gloves.

- Don't forget the seams!

### Place gloves in oven to set wax

- Warm the gloves for 5 minutes to help the wax soak in and to prep for another coat.

### Repeat process 2-3 times

- When the gloves no longer absorb the wax, they are fully waterproof!
- Buff excess wax with a clean rag.
